# Blob Creation Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the performance characteristics of n2s blob creation, documenting findings from comprehensive testing of the core blob creation workflow. The analysis covers encryption algorithm selection, blob structure optimization, and performance bottlenecks.

## Blob Creation Workflow

The finalized blob creation process follows this pipeline:

```
Original File → LZ4 Compress → Encrypt → Base64 Encode → JSON with Metadata → Write Blob
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **File Reading**: Read entire file content into memory
2. **LZ4 Compression**: Compress file content using LZ4 frame format
3. **Blobid Generation**: `BLAKE3(path:file_hash)` creates deterministic identifier
4. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with salt from blobid (100k iterations)
5. **Encryption**: AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 with deterministic nonce from blobid
6. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert encrypted bytes to ASCII string
7. **JSON Creation**: Combine encrypted content with plaintext metadata
8. **Blob Writing**: Write JSON to file named with blobid

### Blob Structure

```json
{
  "encrypted_content": "base64_encoded_encrypted_compressed_data",
  "metadata": {
    "path": "relative/path/to/file.txt",
    "size": 12345,
    "timestamp": 1749388804.3256009,
    "file_hash": "blake3_hash_of_original_content"
  }
}
```

## Encryption Algorithm Performance Analysis

### Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Time/File | Throughput | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Age | ~1200ms | 0.8 MB/s | Unusable for production |
| AES-GCM | ~14ms | 28-41 MB/s | Production ready |
| ChaCha20-Poly1305 | ~14ms | Similar to AES-GCM | Alternative to AES-GCM |

### Key Findings

**Age Encryption Issues:**
- Constant ~1.2 second processing time regardless of file size
- Appears to have significant per-operation overhead
- 1000x+ slower than modern AEAD ciphers

**AEAD Cipher Performance:**
- AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 show similar performance characteristics
- PBKDF2 key derivation dominates encryption time (~14ms of ~17ms total)
- Actual encryption/decryption is extremely fast (<1ms)

## Deterministic Encryption Design

### Challenge
Traditional encryption uses random nonces/IVs, making identical content produce different encrypted outputs. This breaks deduplication since the same file content must always produce the same blobid and encrypted blob.

### Solution
Derive deterministic salt and nonce from blobid:

```python
blob_bytes = bytes.fromhex(blobid)
salt = blob_bytes[:16]   # First 16 bytes for PBKDF2 salt
nonce = blob_bytes[-12:] # Last 12 bytes for AEAD nonce
```

### Security Considerations
- **Salt reuse**: Same content produces same salt, but PBKDF2 output differs due to password
- **Nonce reuse**: Same nonce used for same content, but different keys make this safe
- **Key derivation**: 100k PBKDF2 iterations provide sufficient computational cost
- **Content privacy**: File content remains encrypted; only metadata is plaintext

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Breakdown (263 files, 25.1MB total)

| Operation | Avg Time/File | Percentage | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Read | 0.0ms | <1% | File I/O negligible for small files |
| Compress | 0.1ms | <1% | LZ4 extremely fast |
| Encrypt | 14.0ms | 82% | PBKDF2 key derivation dominates |
| JSON | 0.3ms | 2% | JSON serialization minimal |
| Write | 0.1ms | <1% | Blob output negligible |
| **Total** | **17.0ms** | **100%** | |

### Aggregate Performance
- **Processing Rate**: 68.4 files/second
- **Overall Throughput**: 6.5 MB/s (limited by many small files)
- **Per-file Throughput**: 3.3 MB/s average
- **Compression Ratio**: 1.23 average (25.1MB → 27.9MB including metadata overhead)

### Performance Scaling Expectations

**CPU-Bound Characteristics:**
- Encryption time dominates and is independent of file size for small files
- PBKDF2 iterations are pure CPU work (100k SHA256 operations)
- Suggests excellent parallelization potential

**Expected Scaling with File Size:**
- Small files (<1MB): Fixed 14ms encryption overhead dominates
- Large files (>10MB): Should see improved throughput as encryption time becomes proportional to content size
- Very large files: May become I/O bound depending on storage

## Blob Structure Optimization

### Design Evolution

**Initial Approach**: Encrypt entire JSON blob
- Required decryption to access any metadata
- Larger encryption payload
- No disaster recovery without decryption

**Final Approach**: Encrypt content only, plaintext metadata
- Human-readable metadata without decryption
- Smaller encryption payload (content only)
- Disaster recovery possible by reading blob files directly
- Better debugging and operational visibility

### Base64 Encoding Trade-offs

**Overhead**: 33% size increase (4 bytes per 3 input bytes)
**Benefits**: 
- JSON compatibility (binary data not supported)
- Human-readable encrypted content (for debugging)
- Standard encoding with broad tool support
- Acceptable overhead given compression reduces payload size

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hex encoding: 100% overhead (worse than base64)
- Separate binary files: Increased complexity, two files per blob
- Binary formats (MessagePack): Loses human-readable metadata benefit

## Testing Methodology

### Test Setup
- **Hardware**: Linux development environment
- **File Types**: Mixed content (text, binary, various sizes)
- **Measurement**: `time.perf_counter()` for high-resolution timing
- **Sample Size**: 263 files totaling 25.1MB

### Metrics Collected
- Per-operation timing breakdown
- File-by-file processing statistics
- Aggregate performance metrics
- Compression ratios
- Blob size analysis

### Validation
- **Deterministic verification**: Same files produce identical blobs across runs
- **Correctness**: Encrypt/decrypt roundtrip verification
- **Performance consistency**: Multiple test runs show stable results

## Conclusions

1. **Encryption algorithm choice is critical**: Age's poor performance made it unusable, while AES-GCM/ChaCha20 provide excellent performance
2. **Deterministic encryption is achievable**: Blobid-derived salt/nonce provides consistency without compromising security
3. **CPU-bound workload**: 82% of time spent in key derivation suggests excellent parallelization potential
4. **Metadata separation beneficial**: Plaintext metadata significantly improves operational characteristics
5. **Performance is production-ready**: 68+ files/sec with 6-41 MB/s throughput meets requirements

## Future Testing Recommendations

1. **Large file scaling**: Test with 100MB+ files to identify I/O bottlenecks
2. **Parallel processing**: Measure concurrent worker performance scaling
3. **Storage type impact**: Compare SSD, HDD, and network storage performance
4. **Memory usage analysis**: Profile memory consumption patterns
5. **Algorithm comparison**: Direct AES-GCM vs ChaCha20-Poly1305 performance comparison
